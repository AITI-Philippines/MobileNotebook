# Mobile Notebook #
<p>Mobile notebook is basically, a note-taking mobile application integrated to google documents. The user will register with his school and class schedules and the application will save it to its online server. Anyone in a specific class can take a picture of the writings/notes and share it to the whole class(those who are registered in the server under that class). The application will recognize the class on which the photo was taken, then auto-fill the field where the photo will be uploaded. The user has the prerogative to change the content of the field. The application will then upload it to the server and everyone in that class will have access to the file through google docs. Anyone that is registered in the class can add comments about the photo. The application can aid students by letting them focus more on the lecture instead of taking down notes. Their class performance will increase and they will also help in reducing paper consumption.</p>
