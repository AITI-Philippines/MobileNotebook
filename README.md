==============
Mobile Notebook is a mobile application that serves as a virtual notebook. The user can take a picture of the writings they want to add to their notes, and it will be processed using Optical Character Recognition technology (OCR). They can create several “notebooks” and share their notes to their friends. They can also review and edit their notes, and add annotations. It also has a reminder feature with alarm, so they will be reminded of their assignments. The application can aid students by letting them focus more on the lecture instead of taking down notes. Their class performance will increase and they will also help in reducing paper consumption. It has a very large target market for almost everyone uses notebooks and this application will look appealing to them. At first look, the idea is quite advanced and complex for the group to produce a prototype in tow weeks time. But with the help of existing technologies and libraries for developers that utilizes optical character recognition, it is not impossible. One problem is, these technologies are not open-source.
